# paintingStore
This is a painting store management project to learn how to use Spring boot.
I am doing this exercise by following the YouTube project Spring boot simple project-Book Store Management, 
using MySql, Thymeleaf, JPA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnur2ujza6k&t=4275s.
It is a very good example to learn and understang spring boot.
